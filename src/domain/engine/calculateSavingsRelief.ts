/**
 * @module domain/engine/calculateSavingsRelief
 * @description
 * The Savings Relief module is the first responder in the Splurge recovery waterfall.
 * It identifies "Temporal Insolvency" caused by soft savings commitments and calculates
 * the surgical maneuvers required to restore the safety buffer.
 * * ### Architectural Principles:
 * 1. **Integer Supremacy:** To avoid IEEE 754 floating-point errors (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3),
 * all internal calculations are performed in **Cents** using `Math.round(x * 100)`.
 * 2. **Priority-Based Attrition:** The engine targets "Soft" commitments (constraints: "soft")
 * and sacrifices them in descending order of their priority value.
 * 3. **The Savings Paradox Solver:** It recognizes that "saving" is a discretionary choice.
 * If saving $500 results in a $100 shortfall, this module "unlocks" that liquidity to maintain
 * baseline survival and buffer integrity.
 * * ### Relief Gap Formula:
 * The required relief is defined as the distance from the deepest timeline "ditch"
 * back to the user's defined safety margin:
 * ReliefGap = |MinBalance| + Buffer
 * * @param {TimelineEvent[]} timelineEvents - The chronologically ordered event stream from the generator.
 * @param {number} buffer - The safety threshold (in dollars) that must be maintained.
 * * @returns {SavingsRelief | null}
 * Returns a set of ReliefActions if a shortfall is detected and soft commitments are available.
 * Returns `null` if the user is already stable or no soft commitments exist to pivot.
 * * @throws {ValidationError} If the timeline is empty or null.
