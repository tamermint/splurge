/**
 * @module domain/engine/calculateStructuralDeficit
 * @description
 * The Structural Deficit module acts as the "Final Boss" of the Splurge recovery waterfall.
 * Its primary purpose is to perform a forensic analysis of a cash flow crisis when
 * Tier 1 (Savings Relief) and Tier 2 (Bill Deferrals) have failed to restore stability.
 * * ### Architectural Role:
 * 1. **Stability Thresholding:** Unlike traditional accounting which looks for a $0 balance,
 * this module defines "Failure" as dropping below the user's defined `buffer`.
 * 2. **Post-Maneuver Accounting:** It calculates the remaining gap *after* all potential
 * maneuvers (relief and deferrals) have been applied.
 * 3. **Temporal Forensic Analysis:** It identifies the "On-set" (Critical Date) and the
 * "Recovery Horizon" (Resolution Date) to determine if a crisis is temporary or terminal.
 * * ### Distance-to-Stability Math:
 * The module calculates the shortfall required to return the user to a "Stable" status using:
 * $$Shortfall = \max(0, Buffer - BaseShortfall)$$
 * where $BaseShortfall$ is the predicted balance after Tier 1 maneuvers.
 * * @param {TimelineEvent[]} timeline - The chronologically ordered stream of computed events.
 * @param {SavingsRelief | null} relief - The outcome of the Tier 1 Savings Relief engine.
 * @param {DeferralPlan | null} deferrals - The outcome of the Tier 2 Deferral engine.
 * @param {number} buffer - The safety margin required to maintain a "Stable" liquidity status.
 * * @returns {StructuralDeficit | null}
 * Returns a forensic deficit object if the user remains underwater, or `null` if the situation is resolved.
 * * @throws {ValidationError} If the timeline is empty or malformed.
